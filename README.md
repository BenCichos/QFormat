## QOI - Quite OK Image Format

The QOI Format is a lossless image format, that offers faster encoding and decoding than the PNG image format. QOI was created by Dominic Szablewski. The QOI Format can be used to encode 24-bit RGB, or 32-bit RGBA images. You can find more information about the format on https://qoiformat.org or the github repository https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi.
